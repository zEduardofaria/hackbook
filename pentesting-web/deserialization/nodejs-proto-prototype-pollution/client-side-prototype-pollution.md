## Discovering using Automatic tools

The tools [**https://github.com/dwisiswant0/ppfuzz**](https://github.com/dwisiswant0/ppfuzz?tag=v1.0.0)**,** [**https://github.com/kleiton0x00/ppmap**](https://github.com/kleiton0x00/ppmap) **and** [**https://github.com/kosmosec/proto-find**](https://github.com/kosmosec/proto-find) can be used to **find prototype pollution vulnerabilities**.

Moreover, you could also use the **browser extension** [**PPScan**](https://github.com/msrkp/PPScan) to **automatically** **scan** the **pages** you **access** for prototype pollution vulnerabilities.

### Finding the root cause of Prototype Pollution <a href="#5530" id="5530"></a>

Once any of the tools have **identified** a **prototype pollution vulnerability**, if the **code** is **not** very **complex**, you can **search** the JS code for the **keywords** **`location.hash/decodeURIComponent/location.search`** in Chrome Developer Tools and find the vulnerable place.

If the code is large and complex there is an easy way to **discover where is the vulnerable code**:

* Using one of the tools **find a vulnerability** and get a **payload** that will **set a property** in the constructor. In ppmap you will be given something like: `constructor[prototype][ppmap]=reserved`
* Now, set a **breakpoint in the first line of JS code** that is going to be executed in the page, and refresh the page with the payload so the **execution is paused there**.
* While the JS execution is paused **paste the following script in the JS console**. This code will indicate once the property 'ppmap' is created, so you will be able to find where it was created.

```javascript
function debugAccess(obj, prop, debugGet=true){

    var origValue = obj[prop];

    Object.defineProperty(obj, prop, {
        get: function () {
            if ( debugGet )
                debugger;
            return origValue;
        },
        set: function(val) {
            debugger;
            return origValue = val;
        }
    });

};

debugAccess(Object.prototype, 'ppmap')
```

Go back to **Sources** and click ‚Äú**Resume** script **execution**‚Äù. After you do that, the whole **javascript** will be **executed** and ppmap will be polluted again as expected. With the help of the Snippet we can find where exactly the ppmap property is polluted. We can **click** on the **Call** **Stack** and you will face **different** **stacks** where the **pollution** **happened**.

But which one to choose? Most of the time Prototype Pollution happens on Javascript libraries, so aim for the stack which is attached to the .js library files (look at the right side just like in the image to know which endpoint the stack is attached to). In this case we have 2 stacks on line 4 and 6, logically we will choose the 4th line because that line is the first time where Pollution happens, which mean that this line is the reason of the vulnerability. Clicking on the stack will redirect us to the vulnerable code.

## Finding Script Gadgets

The gadget is the **code that will be abused once a PP vulnerability is discovered**.

If the application is simple, we can **search** for **keywords** like **`srcdoc/innerHTML/iframe/createElement`** and review the source code and check if it l**eads to javascript execution**. Sometimes, mentioned techniques might not find gadgets at all. In that case, pure source code review reveals some nice gadgets like the below example.

### Example Finding PP gadget in Mithil library code
