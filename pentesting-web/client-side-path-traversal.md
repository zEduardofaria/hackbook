# Client Side Path Traversal



## Basic Information

A client side path traversal occurs when you can **manipulate the path of a URL** that is going to be **sent to a user to visit in a legit way** or that a user is somehow going to be **forced to visit for example via JS or CSS**.

In [**this writeup**](https://erasec.be/blog/client-side-path-manipulation/), it was possible to **change the invite URL** so it would end up **canceling a card**.

In [**this writeup**](https://mr-medi.github.io/research/2022/11/04/practical-client-side-path-traversal-attacks.html), it was possible to combine a **client side path traversal via CSS** (it was possible to change the path where a CSS resource was loaded from) with an **open redirect** to load the CSS resource from an **attacker controlled domain**.
