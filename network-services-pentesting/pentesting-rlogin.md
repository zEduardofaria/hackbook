# 513 - Pentesting Rlogin

 

## Basic Information

This service was mostly used in the old days for remote administration but now because of security issues this service has been replaced by the slogin and the ssh.

**Default port:** 513

```
PORT    STATE SERVICE
513/tcp open  login
```

## **Login**

```
apt-get install rsh-client
```

This command will try to **login** to the remote host by using the login name **root** (for this service **you don't need to know any password**):

```
rlogin <IP> -l <username>
```
