Inside a Jira instance **any user** (even **non-authenticated**) can **check its privileges** in `/rest/api/2/mypermissions` or `/rest/api/3/mypermissions` . These endpoints will return your current privileges.\
If a **non-authenticated** user have any **privilege**, this is a **vulnerability** (bounty?).\
If an **authenticated** user have any **unexpected privilege**, this a a **vuln**.

```bash
#Check non-authenticated privileges
curl https://jira.some.example.com/rest/api/2/mypermissions | jq | grep -iB6 '"havePermission": true'
```
