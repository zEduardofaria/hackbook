# 514 - Pentesting Rsh

 

## Basic Information

**Rsh** use **.rhosts** files and **/etc/hosts.equiv** for authentication. These methods relied on IP addresses and DNS (Domain Name System) for authentication. However, spoofing IP addresses is fairly easy, especially if the attacker is on the local network.

Furthermore, the **.rhosts** files were stored in users' home directories, which were typically stored on NFS (Network File System) volumes. (from here: [https://www.ssh.com/ssh/rsh](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/rsh)).

**Default port**: 514

## Login

```
rsh <IP> <Command>
rsh <IP> -l domain\user <Command>
rsh domain/user@<IP> <Command>
rsh domain\\user@<IP> <Command>
```
