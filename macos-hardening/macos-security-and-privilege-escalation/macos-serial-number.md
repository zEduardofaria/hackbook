## 1 - Week of manufacturing

The fifth character represent the week in which the device was manufactured. There are 28 possible characters in this spot: **the digits 1-9 are used to represent the first through ninth weeks**, and the **characters C through Y**, **excluding** the vowels A, E, I, O, and U, and the letter S, represent the **tenth through twenty-seventh weeks**. For devices manufactured in the **second half of the year, add 26** to the number represented by the fifth character of the serial number. For example, a product with a serial number whose fourth and fifth digits are ‚ÄúJH‚Äù was manufactured in the 40th week of 2012.

## 3 - Uniq Code

The next three digits are an identifier code which **serves to differentiate each Apple device of the same model** which is manufactured in the same location and during the same week of the same year, ensuring that each device has a different serial number. 

## 4 - Serial number

The last four digits of the serial number represent the **product‚Äôs model**.
