# Static Analysis

## otool

```bash
otool -L /bin/ls #List dynamically linked libraries
otool -tv /bin/ps #Decompile application
```

## SuspiciousPackage

[**SuspiciousPackage**](https://mothersruin.com/software/SuspiciousPackage/get.html) is a tool useful to inspect **.pkg** files (installers) and see what is inside before installing it.\
These installers have `preinstall` and `postinstall` bash scripts that malware authors usually abuse to **persist** **the** **malware**.

## hdiutil

This tool allows to **mount** Apple disk images (**.dmg**) files to inspect them before running anything:

```bash
hdiutil attach ~/Downloads/Firefox\ 58.0.2.dmg
```

It will be mounted in `/Volumes`

## Objective-C

When a function is called in a binary that uses objective-C, the compiled code instead of calling that function, it will call **`objc_msgSend`**. Which will be calling the final function:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (560).png>)

The params this function expects are:

* The first parameter (**self**) is "a pointer that points to the **instance of the class that is to receive the message**". Or more simply put, it‚Äôs the object that the method is being invoked upon. If the method is a class method, this will be an instance of the class object (as a whole), whereas for an instance method, self  will point to an instantiated instance of the class as an object.
* The second parameter, (**op**), is "the selector of the method that handles the message". Again, more simply put, this is just the **name of the method.**
* The remaining parameters are any **values that are required by the method** (op).

| **Argument**      | **Register**                                                    | **(for) objc\_msgSend**                                |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1st argument**  | **rdi**                                                         | **self: object that the method is being invoked upon** |
| **2nd argument**  | **rsi**                                                         | **op: name of the method**                             |
| **3rd argument**  | **rdx**                                                         | **1st argument to the method**                         |
| **4th argument**  | **rcx**                                                         | **2nd argument to the method**                         |
| **5th argument**  | **r8**                                                          | **3rd argument to the method**                         |
| **6th argument**  | **r9**                                                          | **4th argument to the method**                         |
| **7th+ argument** | <p><strong>rsp+</strong><br><strong>(on the stack)</strong></p> | **5th+ argument to the method**                        |

## Packed binaries

* Check for high entropy
* Check the strings (is there is almost no understandable string, packed)
* The UPX packer for MacOS generates a section called "\_\_XHDR"

# Dynamic Analysis

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that in order to debug binaries, **SIP needs to be disabled** (`csrutil disable` or `csrutil enable --without debug`) or to copy the binaries to a temporary folder and **remove the signature** with `codesign --remove-signature <binary-path>` or allow the debugging of the binary (you can use [this script](https://gist.github.com/carlospolop/a66b8d72bb8f43913c4b5ae45672578b))
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that in order to **instrument system binarie**s, (such as `cloudconfigurationd`) on macOS, **SIP must be disabled** (just removing the signature won't work).
{% endhint %}

## dtruss

```bash
dtruss -c ls #Get syscalls of ls
dtruss -c -p 1000 #get syscalls of PID 1000
```

## ktrace

You can use this one even with **SIP activated**

```bash
ktrace trace -s -S -t c -c ls | grep "ls("
```

## dtrace

It allows users access to applications at an extremely **low level** and provides a way for users to **trace** **programs** and even change their execution flow. Dtrace uses **probes** which are **placed throughout the kernel** and are at locations such as the beginning and end of system calls.

The available probes of dtrace can be obtained with:

```bash
dtrace -l | head
   ID   PROVIDER            MODULE                          FUNCTION NAME
    1     dtrace                                                     BEGIN
    2     dtrace                                                     END
    3     dtrace                                                     ERROR
   43    profile                                                     profile-97
   44    profile                                                     profile-199
```

The probe name consists of four parts: the provider, module, function, and name (`fbt:mach_kernel:ptrace:entry`). If you not specifies some part of the name, Dtrace will apply that part as a wildcard.

A more detailed explanation and more examples can be found in [https://illumos.org/books/dtrace/chp-intro.html](https://illumos.org/books/dtrace/chp-intro.html)

### Examples

* In line

```bash
#Count the number of syscalls of each running process
sudo dtrace -n 'syscall:::entry {@[execname] = count()}'
```

* script

```bash
syscall:::entry
/pid == $1/
{
}

#Log every syscall of a PID
sudo dtrace -s script.d 1234 
```

```bash
syscall::open:entry
{
    printf("%s(%s)", probefunc, copyinstr(arg0));
}
syscall::close:entry
{
        printf("%s(%d)\n", probefunc, arg0);
}

#Log files opened and closed by a process
sudo dtrace -s b.d -c "cat /etc/hosts"
```

```bash
syscall:::entry
{
        ;
}
syscall:::return
{
        printf("=%d\n", arg1);
}

#Log sys calls with values
sudo dtrace -s syscalls_info.d -c "cat /etc/hosts"
```

## ProcessMonitor

[**ProcessMonitor**](https://objective-see.com/products/utilities.html#ProcessMonitor) is a very useful tool to check the process related actions a process is performing (for example, monitor which new processes a process is creating).

## FileMonitor

[**FileMonitor**](https://objective-see.com/products/utilities.html#FileMonitor) allows to monitor file events (such as creation, modifications, and deletions) providing detailed information about such events.

## fs\_usage

Allows to follow actions performed by processes:

```bash
fs_usage -w -f filesys ls #This tracks filesystem actions of proccess names containing ls
fs_usage -w -f network curl #This tracks network actions
```

## TaskExplorer

[**Taskexplorer**](https://objective-see.com/products/taskexplorer.html) is useful to see the **libraries** used by a binary, the **files** it's using and the **network** connections.\
It also checks the binary processes against **virustotal** and show information about the binary.

## lldb

**lldb** is the de **facto tool** for **macOS** binary **debugging**.

```bash
lldb ./malware.bin
lldb -p 1122
lldb -n malware.bin
lldb -n malware.bin --waitfor
```

| **stepi (s)**                 | Execute the next instruction. Unlike the nexti command, this command will step into function calls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **finish (f)**                | Execute the rest of the instructions in the current function (‚Äúframe‚Äù) return and halt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

When calling the **`objc_sendMsg`** function, the **rsi** register holds the **name of the method** as a null-terminated (‚ÄúC‚Äù) string. To print the name via lldb do:

`(lldb) x/s $rsi: 0x1000f1576: "startMiningWithPort:password:coreCount:slowMemory:currency:"`

`(lldb) print (char*)$rsi:`\
`(char *) $1 = 0x00000001000f1576 "startMiningWithPort:password:coreCount:slowMemory:currency:"`

## Anti-Dynamic Analysis

### VM detection

* The command **`sysctl hw.model`** returns "Mac" when the **host is a MacOS** but something different when it's a VM.
* Playing with the values of **`hw.logicalcpu`** and **`hw.physicalcpu`** some malwares try to detect if it's a VM.
* Some malwares can also **detect** if the machine is **VMware** based on the MAC address (00:50:56).
* It's also possible to find **if a process is being debugged** with a simple code such us:
  * `if(P_TRACED == (info.kp_proc.p_flag & P_TRACED)){ //process being debugged }`
* It can also invoke the **`ptrace`** system call with the **`PT_DENY_ATTACH`** flag. This **prevents** a deb**u**gger from attaching and tracing.
  * You can check if the **`sysctl` ** or**`ptrace`** function is being **imported** (but the malware could import it dynamically)
  * As noted in this writeup, ‚Äú[Defeating Anti-Debug Techniques: macOS ptrace variants](https://alexomara.com/blog/defeating-anti-debug-techniques-macos-ptrace-variants/)‚Äù :\
    ‚Äú_The message Process # exited with **status = 45 (0x0000002d)** is usually a tell-tale sign that the debug target is using **PT\_DENY\_ATTACH**_‚Äù

# Fuzzing

## [ReportCrash](https://ss64.com/osx/reportcrash.html#:\~:text=ReportCrash%20analyzes%20crashing%20processes%20and%20saves%20a%20crash%20report%20to%20disk.\&text=ReportCrash%20also%20records%20the%20identity,when%20a%20crash%20is%20detected.)

ReportCrash **analyzes crashing processes and saves a crash report to disk**. A crash report contains information that can **help a developer diagnose** the cause of a crash.\
For applications and other processes **running in the per-user launchd context**, ReportCrash runs as a LaunchAgent and saves crash reports in the user's `~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/`\
For daemons, other processes **running in the system launchd context** and other privileged processes, ReportCrash runs as a LaunchDaemon and saves crash reports in the system's `/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports`

If you are worried about crash reports **being sent to Apple** you can disable them. If not, crash reports can be useful to **figure out how a server crashed**.

```bash
#To disable crash reporting:
launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.ReportCrash.plist
sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.ReportCrash.Root.plist

#To re-enable crash reporting:
launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.ReportCrash.plist
sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.ReportCrash.Root.plist
```

## Sleep

While fuzzing in a MacOS it's important to not allow the Mac to sleep:

* systemsetup -setsleep Never
* pmset, System Preferences
* [KeepingYouAwake](https://github.com/newmarcel/KeepingYouAwake)

### SSH Disconnect

If you are fuzzing via a SSH connection it's important to make sure the session isn't going to day. So change the sshd\_config file with:

* TCPKeepAlive Yes
* ClientAliveInterval 0
* ClientAliveCountMax 0

```bash
sudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist
sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist
```

## Internal Handlers

[**Checkout this section**](./#file-extensions-apps) to find out how you can find which app is responsible of **handling the specified scheme or protocol**.

## Enumerating Network Processes

This interesting to find processes that are managing network data:

```bash
dtrace -n 'syscall::recv*:entry { printf("-> %s (pid=%d)", execname, pid); }' >> recv.log
#wait some time
sort -u recv.log > procs.txt
cat procs.txt
```

Or use `netstat` or `lsof`
