Note that you can add also some payloads to the cloned website like a BeEF hook to "control" the tab of the user. 

There are different tools you can use for this purpose:

## wget

```text
wget -mk -nH
```

## goclone

```bash
#https://github.com/imthaghost/goclone
goclone <url>
```

## Social Engineering Toolit

```bash
#https://github.com/trustedsec/social-engineer-toolkit
```
