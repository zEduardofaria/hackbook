## Using host

```bash
host -t mx businesscorp.com.br
```
```bash
host -t A businesscorp.com.br
```
```bash
host -t ns businesscorp.com.br
```

## Transfer Zone
Might not work like this
```bash
host -l businesscorp.com.br
```
 But if you try to find the ns first, it might work
 ```bash
 host -l businesscorp.com.br ns2.businesscorp.com.br
```
For a more completed response, use
```bash
host -l -a businesscorp.com.br ns2.businesscorp.com.br
```
## Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash

if [ -z "$1" ]; then
  echo "Usage: $0 domain.com"
  exit 1
fi

host -l -a "$1" | grep "has address" | awk '{print $1}'

```
## Reverse search
Find the name server subdomain, and use whois on it
```bash
whois 27.59.174.225

inetenum: 37.59.174.224 - 37.59.174.239
```
```bash
for ip in $(seq 224 239); do host -t ptr 37.59.174.$ip;done
```
