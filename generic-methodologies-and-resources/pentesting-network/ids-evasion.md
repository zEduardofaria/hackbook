Send some packets with a TTL enough to arrive to the IDS/IPS but not enough to arrive to the final system. And then, send another packets with the same sequences as the other ones so the IPS/IDS will think that they are repetitions and won't check them, but indeed they are carrying the malicious content.

**Nmap option:** `--ttlvalue <value>`

# Avoiding signatures

Just add garbage data to the packets so the IPS/IDS signature is avoided.

**Nmap option:** `--data-length 25`

# **Fragmented Packets**

Just fragment the packets and send them. If the IDS/IPS doesn't have the ability to reassemble them, they will arrive to the final host.

**Nmap option:** `-f`

# **Invalid** _**checksum**_

Sensors usually don't calculate checksum for performance reasons. __ So an attacker can send a packet that will be **interpreted by the sensor but rejected by the final host.** Example:

Send a packet with the flag RST and a invalid checksum, so then, the IPS/IDS may thing that this packet is going to close the connection, but the final host will discard the packet as the checksum is invalid.

# **Uncommon IP and TCP options**

A sensor might disregard packets with certain flags and options set within IP and TCP headers, whereas the destination host accepts the packet upon receipt.

# **Overlapping**

It is possible that when you fragment a packet, some kind of overlapping exists between packets (maybe first 8 bytes of packet 2 overlaps with last 8 bytes of packet 1, and 8 last bytes of packet 2 overlaps with first 8 bytes of packet 3). Then, if the IDS/IPS reassembles them in a different way than the final host, a different packet will be interpreted.\
Or maybe, 2 packets with the same offset comes and the host has to decide which one it takes.

* **BSD**: It has preference for packets with smaller _offset_. For packets with same offset, it will choose the first one.
* **Linux**: Like BSD, but it prefers the last packet with the same offset.
* **First** (Windows): First value that comes, value that stays.
* **Last** (cisco): Last value that comes, value that stays.


## Change source port

When performing a port scan, Nmap typically uses random source port numbers for each packet it sends. However, by using the `--source-port` parameter, you can set a fixed source port number for all the scanning packets. This can help in bypassing some IDS or firewall rules that are specifically designed to detect and block Nmap scans based on random or suspicious source port numbers.


```bash
nmap -v -sS -Pn -g 53 172.16.1.5
```
```bash
nc -vn -p 53 172.16.1.5 8180 > /var/www/html/recon.html
```


## Spoof mac address

By randomizing the MAC address, Nmap can make it more challenging for IDS systems to correlate scan activities with a specific device or identify them as potentially malicious

**Nmap option:** `--spoor-mac`

## Change the time of the scan

**Nmap scan:** `-T<0-5`

## Decoy

Cloak a scan with decoy

**Nmap scan:** `-D RND:20`
