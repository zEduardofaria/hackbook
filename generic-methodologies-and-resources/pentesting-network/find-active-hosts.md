# Find active hosts
## Without nmap
```bash
for ip in $(seq 1 254); do sudo hping3 -c 1 172.30.0.$ip --icmp -q -J 2>/dev/null | xargs; done | tee hosts-ok.txt

grep -v ": -" ping.txt | wc -l
```
```bash
fping -C 1 -g 172.30.0.0/24 -a --quiet &> ping.txt

grep "icmp_seq" hosts-ok.txt | wc -l
```

```bash
nmap -sn 37.59.172.224-239
```

-   `-sn`: This option stands for "Ping Scan" and instructs nmap to perform a host discovery scan by sending ICMP echo requests (pings) to the specified IP addresses. It doesn't attempt any further port scanning or service detection.
-   `37.59.172.224-239`: This specifies a range of IP addresses to scan. In this case, it covers the IP addresses from 37.59.172.224 to 37.59.172.239.

By running this command, nmap will send ICMP echo requests to each IP address in the specified range. The tool will then report which hosts are up and responding to the ping requests. This type of scan is useful for quickly identifying active hosts on a network without performing in-depth port scans or service enumeration.

```bash
nmap -sn 172.16.1.0/24
```

-  `172.16.1.0/24`: This is the network address specified in CIDR notation. The "/24" indicates a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, which covers a range of IP addresses from 172.16.1.0 to 172.16.1.255.

```bash
nmap -sn 172.16.1.0/24 -oG allhosts

cat allhosts | cut -d " " -f 2 > activehosts

cat activehosts
```
