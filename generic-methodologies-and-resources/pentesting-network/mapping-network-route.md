# Mapping network route
Ping
### Discover ttl with ping
```bash
ping businesscorp.com.br -c 1
```
### Recognize each host by each ttl value
```bash
ping businesscorp.com.br -c 1 -t 1
ping businesscorp.com.br -c 1 -t 2
ping businesscorp.com.br -c 1 -t 3
(...)
```
## Traceroute
### Mapping the route
```bash
traceroute businesscorp.com.br
```

`-w` We can change the time response limit to try to reach more responses by using `-w 5`
`-m` We can use `-m` to control until where the ttl goes.
`-f` With `-f` we can estipulate the jump we want to start with. `-f 15` means it will count from 15 and so on.
`-A` We can use `-A` to see the AS from each route.
`-n` to avoid to much information from the return
`-I`  Uses ICMP protocol
`-T`  Uses TCP protocol
`-U`  Uses UDP protocol at port 53
`-p` To test ports
