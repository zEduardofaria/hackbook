**Adb is usually located in:**

```bash
#Windows
C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Android\sdk\platform-tools\adb.exe

#MacOS
/Users/<username>/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/adb
```

**Information obtained from:** [**http://adbshell.com/**](http://adbshell.com)

# Connection

```
adb devices
```

This will list the connected devices; if "_**unathorised**_" appears, this means that you have to **unblock** your **mobile** and **accept** the connection.

This indicates to the device that it has to start and adb server in port 5555:

```
adb tcpip 5555
```

Connect to that IP and that Port:

```
adb connect <IP>:<PORT>
```

If you get an error like the following in a Virtual Android software (like Genymotion):

```
adb server version (41) doesn't match this client (36); killing...
```

It's because you are trying to connect to an ADB server with a different version. Just try to find the adb binary the software is using (go to `C:\Program Files\Genymobile\Genymotion` and search for adb.exe)

## Several devices

Whenever you find **several devices connected to your machine** you will need to **specify in which one** you want to run the adb command.

```bash
adb devices
List of devices attached
10.10.10.247:42135	offline
127.0.0.1:5555	device
```

```bash
adb -s 127.0.0.1:5555 shell   
x86_64:/ # whoami                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
root
```

## Port Tunneling

In case the **adb** **port** is only **accessible** from **localhost** in the android device but **you have access via SSH**, you can **forward the port 5555** and connect via adb:

```bash
ssh -i ssh_key username@10.10.10.10 -L 5555:127.0.0.1:5555 -p 2222
adb connect 127.0.0.1:5555
```
