Go to **Cydia** app and add Fridaâ€™s repository by going to **Manage -> Sources -> Edit -> Add** and enter [**https://build.frida.re** ](https://build.frida.re). It will add a new source in the source list. Go to the **frida** **source**, now you should **install** the **Frida** package.

After installed, you can use in your PC the command `frida-ls-devices` and check that the device appears (your PC needs to be able to access it). Execute also `frida-ps -Uia` to check the running processes of the phone.
