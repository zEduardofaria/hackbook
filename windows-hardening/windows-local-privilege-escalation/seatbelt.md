# Start

[You need to compile it](https://github.com/GhostPack/Seatbelt) or [use precompiled binaries \(by me\)](https://github.com/carlospolop/winPE/tree/master/binaries/seatbelt)

```text
SeatbeltNet3.5x64.exe all
SeatbeltNet3.5x64.exe all full #Without filtering
```

I really like the performed filtering.
