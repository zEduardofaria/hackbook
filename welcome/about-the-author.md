# About the author



### Hello!!

This is **Carlos Polop**.

First of all, I want to indicate that **I don't own this entire book**, a lot of **information was copy/pasted from other websites and that content belongs to them** (this is indicated on the pages).

I also want to say **thanks to all the people that share cyber-security related information for free** on the Internet. Thanks to them I learn new hacking techniques that then I add to Hacktricks.\
Moreover, I also **write the results of my own researches** here in HackTricks.

Therefore, I expect that in **HackTricks** you will find **all** the **security tricks** available on the internet about a **topic** + potentially something **extra**. If you find something is **missing**, please, send a **Pull Request** to Hacktricks Github!
