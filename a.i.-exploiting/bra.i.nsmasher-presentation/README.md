# Presentation

**BrainSmasher** is a platform made with the purpose of aiding **pentesters, researcher, students, A.I. Cybersecurity engineers** to practice and learn all the techniques for **exploiting commercial A.I.** applications, by working on specifically crafted labs that reproduce several systems, like face recognition, speech recognition, ensemble image classification, autonomous drive, malware evasion, chatbot, data poisoning etc...

Every month a lab on various topic found in commercial A.I. applications will be posted, with **3 different difficulties** (named challenges), in order to **guide** the user in **understanding** all the mechanics behind it and practice **different** ways of **exploitation**.

Since A.I. applications are relatively new, there is also the possibility that the **harder difficulty challenges for the labs don't have some public known ways of exploitation**, so it's up to you to find the correct solution. Maybe some challenges could need the **combination** of "**standard**" **cybersecurity** techniques with **machine** **learning** adversarial attacks ;)

The platform, which is now in **beta** version, will also feature in the next future **paid** competitions, **job** **offers** posting, **ranking** system, **tutorials** on several A.I. exploit topics, the possibility to **earn** **money** by **proposing** personal **labs** or different challenges, for an already existent A.I. lab applications, to be used by the community and also propose modification already existent challenges in order to augment their robustness vs. the various attacks.

All the **material and the techs for the exploitation of A.I. will be posted here** in a dedicated section of hacktricks.

**While** we are in **beta** version and completing the implementation of all the above described features, the subscription and all the already posted labs with their relative **challenges are free**.\
**So start learning how to exploit A.I. for free while you can in** [**BrA.I.Smasher Website**](https://beta.brainsmasher.eu)\
ENJOY ;)

_A big thanks to Hacktricks and Carlos Polop for giving us this opportunity_

# Registry Challenge

In order to register in [**BrA.I.Smasher** ](https://beta.brainsmasher.eu)you need to solve an easy challenge ([**here**](https://beta.brainsmasher.eu/registrationChallenge)).\
Just think how you can confuse a neuronal network while not confusing the other one knowing that one detects better the panda while the other one is worse...

{% hint style="info" %}
However, if at some point you **don't know how to solve** the challenge, or **even if you solve it**, check out the official solution in [**google colab**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1MR8i\_ATm3bn3CEqwaEnRwF0eR25yKcjn?usp=sharing).
{% endhint %}

I have to tell you that there are **easier ways** to pass the challenge, but this **solution** is **awesome** as you will learn how to pass the challenge performing an **Adversarial Image performing a Fast Gradient Signed Method (FGSM) attack for images.**
